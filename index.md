# Ascending Realms Guide

## Gathering Resources
The main world can't be modified unless you're a part of a town, and the area you want to modify is also part of the same town. In order to gather resources, you must go to the Resource world. This world is reset every day, and can be mined and destroyed freely. To get there, do `/rw tp`.

## Towns
Towns are one of the core pieces of our gameplay experience. If you want to modify the main world in any way, it has to be claimed by a town. Towns are a great way to work together with other players and pool resources. Towns can also set and take a tax in order to pay upkeep on their claims. If a town owner goes inactive, there is an appeal process to replace them.

### Joining a Town
To join a town, simply do `/t join [name]`. If the town is open to the public, you will be able to join it freely. If the town is closed, those who can add you will be notified that you want to join and they can extend you an invitation.

To add a member to a town you're a part of, do `/t add [name]`.

### Creating a Town
If you save up 250g, you'll be able to create your own town by running `/t new [name]`. You'll be able to claim a 48x48 area and accept members to your own town. Be careful though, because each 16x16 plot costs 5g per day! If you can't afford the upkeep on your town, it will fall to ruin. 

Towns can set taxes on their residents to be taken every day by doing `/t set taxes [amount]`. This can be switched between a percentage of total and a flat rate by doing `/t toggle taxpercent`. 

#### Claiming Plots

Towns can also claim plots. Those with permissions can do `/t claim` to claim the current plot they're standing on. They can then set it up for sale by doing `/plot forsale [amount]` and take them off sale by doing `/plot notforsale`.

Plots are safe from non-member modification and from mob griefing.

#### Setting Assistants

Running a town can be tricky, especially with large groups of players. To ease this, you can set assistants. Assistants can claim land, add individuals to the town, adjust plots, and jail people. To make someone an assistant, run `/t rank add [name] assistant`. Sherrifs can also jail people, but without the town modification commands.

### Joining a Nation

Nations allow towns to band together into a larger group with more powers. People can gain titles, and fight in wars as part of nations. Only mayors of towns can decide to join nations.

### Creating a Nation

Nations are much more expensive than towns. They cost 1000g to found, and an additional 100g per day to keep up. However, they allow members to teleport between towns and work together on larger projects. To found a nation, run `/nation new [name]`. You can then invite towns to join by running `/nation add [town name].`

## Ranking Up
Ranking up is as easy as playing on the server. Each rank has a time amount set to the next rank. You can check your playtime by hovering over your name in chat. The rank times are as follows:

| Rank     | Time Requirement | Reward | Vote Reward | Vote Party Reward |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------ | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Wanderer | 5 minutes        | 100g   | 5g          | 75g               |
| Citizen  | 2 hours          | 250g   | 10g         | 100g              |
| Denizen  | 8 hours          | 500g   | 10g         | 125g              |
| Renowned | 2 days           | 1000g  | 15g         | 150g              |
| Noble    | 7 days           | 2500g  | 20g         | 200g              |

## Earning Money

Earning money happens in many ways, and makes your life much easier. Don't want to go out and gather materials for your next project? The `/materials` shop is there for you. Need some raw diamonds? Go visit nearby player shops.

### Voting

Voting is the easiest way to get money. Each rank earns more money, as shown in the table above.

### Playing

Every 10 minutes spent on the server gives you 1g.

### Player Shops

You can set up shops to sell what you produce. To create a shop, punch a chest with what you want to sell, then type the price per item in chat. You can then shift + right click the sign to change settings on the shop.

### Mob Hunting

Each hostile mob has a rare drop that can be used for crafting, or can be used to sell back to the server. This can be done from the `/sell` menu.

## Teleportation

To encourage towns, normal teleportation is not enabled on this server. Instead, you can use towns to teleport where you need to go or bind teleportation scrolls to locations around the map.

### How do I craft a teleportation scroll?
Teleporation scrolls are crafted like so:
